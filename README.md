# Calista's Project Navigator

Welcome to my personal **cross-domain learning and project dashboard**.

This space highlights selected projects spanning **ML × Web experiments**, **general coding labs**, and **programming language exploration**.

## Most Valuable Projects (MVP)

These are the projects that best represent my current skills, learning focus, and experimentation mindset across domains.

## Projects

### [Project A: ML × Web Experiment](https://github.com/calista-labs)

Experimental projects exploring how machine learning models integrate into web-based systems, including APIs, inference flows, and data-driven interfaces.

### Notes

While many of these projects were initially built through structured learning resources (courses, tutorials, or guided materials), they have been:

* Refactored to improve structure, clarity, and separation of concerns
* Extended with additional experiments, integrations, or variations
* Documented to reflect real-world engineering and learning practices

I believe that learning happens best by **building, experimenting, and iterating**. These projects serve as both a personal learning archive and a reflection of my ongoing growth across multiple technical domains.
